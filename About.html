            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Latjor Sports Foundation (LSF), a non-profit organization, strives to unite the South Sudanese community through sport, bridging connections with change-makers. It was established in 2023 by ex-footballers and the Nasir Boys Associations from Kakuma Refugee Camp members to support young refugees in East African camps. By supporting them with sports equipment and essential resources, the LSF specifically aids disadvantaged children in Kenyan refugee camps, promoting positivity and change. The organization hopes to empower, uplift, and inspire the next generation through sport..</p>
